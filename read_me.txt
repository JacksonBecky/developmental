To run the models in LENS follow the instructions in read_me_commands.txt

To process these results in Matlab run NEW_input_data_CONTROL_GIT.m in Matlab

This will give the conceptual abstraction score for a particular version of a model. If you wish to compare different versions of the model, take the results variables as input to statistical tests.

The meta-analysis input data is in dev_metaa_data.csv.

The confidence intervals and plot can be replicated using this data, by following the R commands availble in the notebook MetaAnalysisCIS.ipynb
